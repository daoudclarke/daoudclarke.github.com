\maketitle

Context-theoretic semantics \citep{Clarke:07} defines a lattice
ordering on the vector space formed from contexts of words. The
lattice meet and join are defined by taking component-wise minimums
and maximums with respect to the basis defined by contexts: there is a
basis vector (dimension) for each context a word can occur in.

However, this ordering is only one that is possible on the vector
space. Here we consider two others and evaluate their plausibility for
defining entailment between vector representations of meaning.

\section{Motivation}

In \citep{Clarke:12}, a context theory is defined as follows:
\begin{definition}[Context Theory]
A context theory is a tuple $\langle A, \mathcal{A}, \xi, V, \psi
\rangle$, where $A$ is a set (the alphabet), $\mathcal{A}$ is a unital
algebra over the real numbers, $\xi$ is a function from $A$ to
$\mathcal{A}$, $V$ is an abstract Lebesgue space and $\psi$ is an
injective linear map from $\mathcal{A}$ to $V$.
\end{definition}

The definition is quite complex because the space $V$ in which the
ordering is defined is a bigger space than the space $\mathcal{A}$
used to define composition. If we were able to define an ordering on
$\mathcal{A}$ instead, then this would significantly simplify the
definition, to $\langle A, \mathcal{A}, \xi\rangle$.

The second motivation for investigating new partial orderings is that
we can potentially learn them from data, instead of using a fixed
ordering defined by a basis. A partial ordering divides the space in a
similar way to the planes learnt by support vector machines, so it is
feasible that techniques from this area could be generalised to learn
cones.

\section{Background}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\input{basis.tex}
\caption{The basis associated with a vector space can defines an
  ordering. This shows the join of two elements in the plane with the
  ordering defined by the basis formed from the $x$ and $y$ axes. The
  shaded areas are $u + C$ and $v + C$ where $C$ is the positive
  cone defined by this ordering. }
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A \textbf{partially ordered vector space} is a vector space $V$
together with a partial ordering $\le$ that satisfies:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $u \le v$ then $u + w \le v + w$
\item If $u \le v$ then $\alpha u \le \alpha v$
\end{itemize}
for all $u,v,w \in V$ and $\alpha \ge 0$. If the partial ordering is a
lattice, then the vector space is called a vector lattice or
\textbf{Riesz space}.

\input{cone.tex}

  vector space in the plane.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\input{cones.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{The join of two elements $u$ and $v$ and the spaces $u + C$
  and $v + C$ where $C$ is the cone defining the ordering of the
  space.}
\end{figure}

A \textbf{cone} is a subset $C$ of a vector space satisfying
\begin{itemize}
\item $C + C \subseteq C$
\item $\alpha C \subseteq C$ for all $\alpha \ge 0$
\item $C \cap (-C) = \{0\}$
\end{itemize}
If $V$ is a partially ordered vector space, then the set $V^+ = \{v
\in V : v \ge 0\}$ is a cone, called the \textbf{positive
  cone}. Conversely, given any cone $C$ for a vector space $V$, we can
define a partial ordering on $V$ by $u \le v$ iff $v - u \in C$.

Given a countable set $U = \{u_1, u_2, \ldots\}$ of vectors, the cone
generated by $U$ is the set $C_U = \{v : v = \sum_i \alpha_i u_i\}$ for
some $\alpha_i \ge 0$.

\section{Context Vector Cones}

We can define a positive cone on $\mathcal{A}$ to be the cone
generated by all context vectors, $\hat{A} = \{\hat{x} : x \in A^*\}$. There are
two questions we can ask:
\begin{itemize}
\item Is the ordering interesting, or is likely to turn out to be
  trivial (for example, all strings have meet $0$)?
\item Does the ordering define a lattice? We need the meet operation
in order to define a degree of entailment between strings.
\end{itemize}

In fact it seems that we can't have our cake and eat it, as if the
first question is true, it seems likely the second is false, and vice
versa. If the set $\hat{A}$ is linearly independent, then it seems
that the first is true, and the second false, while the converse holds
in general otherwise. (At the moment, I only have an intuition for
this --- I've yet to prove it).


\section{Plane Orderings}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\input{plane.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{A plane found using a support vector machine can be
  considered as dividing the vector space, and thus defines a partial
  ordering.}
\end{figure}

There is an interesting similarity between how a cone divides the
vector space and the division of a space introduced by a plane, as
used for example in support vector machines. In fact the plane also
defines an ordering, if we define one side to be ``positive''. Then,
as before, $x \le y$ if $y - x$ is on the positive side of the plane.

The ordering is determined entirely by the dimension perpendicular to
the plane. Let $p$ be the vector from the origin to the plane, and
perpendicular to it, and $\bar{p}$ be the one dimensional subspace
generated by $p$. Then $x \le y$ iff $\|\hat{p}(y) - \hat{p}(x)\| \ge
\|p\|$, where by $\hat{p}(x)$ we mean the projection of $x$ onto the
dimension $\hat{p}$, that is, if the projection of $y - x$ onto the
subspace generated by $p$ is greater than or equal to $p$.

In general, this ordering is not a vector space ordering as defined
above unless it passes through the origin. The zero vector is either
positive or negative depending on which side of the plane it
falls. It also does not define a lattice ordering. For example, when
the plane does pass through the origin, the plane defines a total
ordering between vectors purely depending on their position when
projected onto $\hat{p}$. Any vectors on the plane perpendicular to a
point on $\hat{p}$ are equivalent under this partial ordering (thus it
is not strictly a partial ordering).

\section{Relating Strings of Different Lengths with Orderings}

We can use vector space orderings to relate strings of different
lengths. This is similar to the quotient algebra construction of
\cite{Clarke:10}, but allows us to specify the asymmetric relation of
entailment, instead of equating vectors. In fact the two techniques
complement one another: if we need to impose equality between vectors
we can use the quotient algebra construction, and if we need to relate
two vectors by entailment then we can change the ordering.

For example, if we wish to impose the conjunctive nature of ``and'' on
the vector space, we can do this by requiring that $uav \le u$ and
$uav \le v$ for all $u$ and $v$ where $a$ is the vector for
``and''. We can do the same for ``or'' with $u \le uov$ and $v\le uov$
where $o$ is the vector for ``or''.

Similarly, we can make all adjectives restrict the properties of the
nouns they operate on by making $au \le u$ for all adjective vectors
$a$ and all noun space vectors $u$.

This also gives us a surprising answer for what the sentence space
should look like: it doesn't really matter, as long as the ordering
between sentences can be specified correctly. For example, we can just
use the tensor product between sentences but ensure that $s_1s_2 \le
s_1$ and $s_1s_2\le s_2$.

In a sense, this is like imposing a logic on top of the vector space
structure, where the rules of the logic are encapsulated in the
positive cone.
