\section{Introduction}

Current approaches to vector-based semantics take the following
two-stage approach:
\begin{itemize}
\item Find vectors for terms based on their occurrences in large
  corpora
\item Define or learn a composition for these vectors
\end{itemize}
Here we propose investigating the theory behind a more holistic
approach in which the vectors and composition are learnt
simultaneously.

This idea is inspired by looking at logical approaches to semantics
and contrasting them with current approaches to vector-based
semantics.

\section{Approaches to Logical Semantics}

There are two main approaches to logical semantics, which I shall call
the ``theorem proving'' approach and the ``model building''
approach. In either case I assume we have the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A collection of sentences forming the \textbf{background
  knowledge}. This may include pseudo-sentences derived from an
  ontology, such as ``all cats are animals''.
\item The \textbf{text} and \textbf{hypothesis} sentences
\end{itemize}
We want to know if the text implies the hypothesis given the
background knowledge.

In both approaches, each sentence is translated to some logical form.
