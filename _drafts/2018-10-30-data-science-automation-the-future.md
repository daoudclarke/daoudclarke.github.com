<!-- A lot of data science work is about tweaking the behaviour of a piece -->

As a data scientist, my job sometimes involves automating things that
would normally be done by a person. Normally this means that the
company achieves more with the same number of employees, but
ultimately, fewer people are needed to achieve the same result as
before.

It had never seriously occurred to me that my own job was in
danger. Until yesterday. I attended the
[H2O AI World](http://h2oworld.h2o.ai/h2o-world-london/) conference
at the Hilton Hotel in Mayfair, London (yes, very posh). The first
thing presented was a product called "Driverless AI". This is an
automated machine learning tool developed by H2O.ai. It claims to do
automatically what currently requires a data scientist with years of
experience: build a machine learning model with state-of-the-art
performance.

At first I was sceptical, but seeing it in action, and seeing the
people working on it talk about how it was built, I was convinced that
automated machine learning is indeed the future of data science. It
may not be this particular tool that becomes ubiquitous (there are
already plenty of competitors), but the reality is that a machine can
already do a lot of what I do better than I'm doing it, in less
time. It is only a matter of time before using this type of tool
becomes the norm.

What is Automated Machine Learning?
-----------------------------------

[Automated machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning)
is the task of building the best possible predictive model from
training data without any human input in choosing the learning
algorithm or hyperparameters. It can include feature extraction and
feature selection, as Driverless AI does. Other tools don't do this,
for example the open source tools
[AutoML](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html)
based on H2O, and
[auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/) which is
built on Scikit-learn.

Unfortunately for me, this is the bit of data science that I enjoy the
most. I like tweaking the algorithm and hyperparameters to see if I
can improve the accuracy. I like thinking carefully about the problem
to identify which features are most likely to be useful. I like
running an experiment and seeing which of my ideas work the best.


Is my job in danger?
--------------------

Of course the messaging with Driverless AI is "we want to help data
scientists become more powerful; do more stuff!" However it inevitably
follows that if we can do more stuff, then not so many of us are
needed. If the software enables one data scientist to do the work of
five, then four fifths of data scientists will not be needed any
more.

This could be offset to some degree by the continuing growth in data
science and need for data scientists. It is possible that as automated
machine learning grows, the number of data scientists just levels
off. One thing is for sure though, a data scientist's job will look
quite different.


What will a data scientist's job look like?
------------------------------------------

Of course there will still be data science work to do, but the nature
of the work will be very different. These things will still need to be
done:

 - Identifying a business problem that can be solved with data science
 - Identifying the data that is needed and getting hold of that data
 - Extracting and preprocessing the data
 - Identifying the metrics relating to the data that are important to
   the business
 - Making use of an automated machine learning tool to optimise these
   metrics using the data
 - Engineering a solution for production that makes use of the model
   and possibly the model building process.

This is what I imagine the work of a data scientist will look
like. Basically, everything we do now, but with less data science.


What about coding?
------------------

Right now there are a lot of things that automated machine learning
can't do. For example, the NLP tools that Driverless AI provides
seem fairly primitive. Similarly, they don't use many deep learning
models like long short-term memory (LSTM) models. This means that in
the short to medium term there are still many problems that will need
to be



What should I do now?
