Using Online Ads as a Market Research Tool for your Startup Idea
================================================================

How to validate an idea for a startup, side-project or small business?
There's no easy answer. I have so many ideas for projects to work on;
how should I know which one will be most likely to turn into a
success? I've found a relatively painless way of validating (or more
likely invalidating) an idea using online advertising. I've used this
technique a few times, both for consumer and B2B products, and found
it really useful. In order to try this out, you'll need:

 - An idea
 - The ability to build or acquire a landing page
 - A few hundred pounds to spend on advertising

Spending money on advertising may seem like a waste when you don't
have a product yet, but the value of it is in *learning whether it's
worth building a product.* Building a product is time-consuming and
costly and if you can avoid building the wrong thing, in my opinion,
that's a win. Note that I'm not advocating using advertising to
acquire customers; that may or may not work for you, depending on your
product. What I'm proposing is using advertising just for validating
an idea.

I'll talk through my experience trying this out for ReplyCraft
