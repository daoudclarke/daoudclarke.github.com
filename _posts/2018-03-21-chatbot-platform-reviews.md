It's quite overwhelming how many chatbot platforms there are. How
should I know which one to choose? I created
[ChatbotTech](https://chatbottech.io/) to solve this problem. It's a
site that reviews and rates all* the chatbot platforms so you don't
have to.

*some. In fact it's quite hard to know which ones to review, there are
so many. So far, I've opted for this strategy: if I see it, I put it
on my list to review. If you spot one I've missed that you think I
should review, let me know.
