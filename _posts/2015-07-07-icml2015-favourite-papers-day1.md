Aargh! How can I possibly keep all the amazing things I learnt at ICML
today in my head?! Clearly I can't. This is a list of pointers to my
favourite papers from today, and why I think they are cool. This is
mainly for my benefit, but you might like them too!

**Why this paper is cool:** It simultaneously learns word vectors for
  words in two languages without having to learn a mapping between
  them.
