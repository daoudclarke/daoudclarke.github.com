My love she lies alone, she cannot move
<br>And yet her spirit soars across the sky
<br>She's held aloft by words enough to prove
<br>Sustainer's breath can make a woman fly

When I am gone I feel I'm still with you
<br>I leave a piece of me when I depart
<br>This truth - how could it not be true
<br>A part of you could never be apart

What gift I have to give is given now
<br>What song I have to sing already sung
<br>You are the only qibla when I bow
<br>You are the dhikr moistening my tongue

O Lord! Shine down on her your Your loving light!
<br>Let angels keep her comfort in the night
