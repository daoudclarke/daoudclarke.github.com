Benefit People
--------------

Our goal is to benefit as many people as much as possible. Maximise
total benefit. It is important that our goal is _not_ to benefit
companies, organisations or shareholders, but does include customers
_and_ employees. The best kind of benefit is that which helps people
benefit people. This leads to success, and everyone benefits
(including shareholders).

It is also important that we care about the total _benefit_: this is
more general than just maximising wealth, for example.


Make it Easy
------------

Make everything easy. Everything is a conversation. Make conversations
easy. Use simple words and small sentences.


Do it with Love
---------------

Love is real. If you do something with love, it will be different,
better. People will notice. You will be happy.


Resolve Disputes with Experiments
