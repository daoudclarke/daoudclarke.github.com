After watching [Michael Skok's excellent talk on Culture, Vision and
Mission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMIa3XhQpnk), I was tempted
to have a bash at defining the values that I care about. Here's my
attempt.


Benefit People
--------------

Benefit as many people as much as possible. The best kind of benefit
is that which helps people benefit people.


Make it Easy
------------

Make everything easy. Everything is a conversation. Make conversations
easy. Use simple words and small sentences.


Do it with Love
---------------

Love is real. If you do something with love, it will be different,
better.


Try it
------

Every idea is possible. Experiment.


Strength in Diversity
---------------------

Be yourself. Encourage diversity. Accommodate diverse needs.


Family Before Work
------------------

Spend time with your family. Take time for yourself.


Trust
-----

Evaluate yourself. Trust others.
