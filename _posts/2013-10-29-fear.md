Did Fear betwixt the winters hide,
<br>In Autumn, donned his mangy hide,
<br>"Hail all, all's well!" he ravenously cried.
<br>He lied.

And now he darkens darkness skyed,
<br>And now the hands of cold untied,
<br>And now his hunger grows. With every stride
<br>They died.

The mother begs a piece of bread;
<br>She claims the cold's gone to his head.
<br>"Or maybe you could spare a quid instead,"
<br>She said.

How art thou, banker, in thy lair?
<br>Dost thou know that it's unfair?
<br>Canst thou see (wouldst thou give the merest care)
<br>Her stare?

When all's repaid that has been spent
<br>That day there will be no relent
<br>Wouldst thou, before then, offer some consent,
<br>Repent?
