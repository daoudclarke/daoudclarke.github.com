## 1. Ambiguous Goals



## 2. Unrealistic Expectations



## 3. Reinventing the Wheel

## 4. Reality Disconnect

## 5. Poor Data Quality

## 6. Over-engineering

## 7. Flawed Experimental Method

## 8. Perfect Dataset Problem

Datasets vary. If the system you are building will be used on data
from several different sources, or of different types, then the
chances are, your system will behave differently for some of these. If
you build your system around one type of data, it may well end up
being suboptimal. As an example of this, I once applied
[active learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_%28machine_learning%29)
to a sentiment analysis dataset.

## 9. Inappropriate Evaluation Metrics

## 10. Poor Choice of Features

## 11. Poor Choice of Algorithm
