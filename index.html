<h1>Daoud Clarke's Homepage</h1>

<br>I'm currently working for Gorkana Group as a Text Mining Solutions Architect. You can contact me at daoud (dot) clarke (at) gorkana.com.
<br>
<br>I recently completed a <a href="http://www.ktponline.org.uk/">Knowledge Transfer Partnership</a> project with the University of Hertfordshire and Metrica.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>
I'm interested in vector-based and distributional representations of
meaning.  I'm particularly interested in distributional models of
compositionality, and this was the focus of my DPhil work at <a
href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk">the University of Sussex</a>.  My
supervisor was <a href="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/davidw/">David Weir</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm also interested in applications of machine learning and natural language processing, in particular topic clustering, sentiment analysis and named entity recognition.
</p>

<p>
I previously worked at <a href="http://www.delcam.com">Delcam</a> developing machining algorithms for their core library, primarily used in their flagship product <a href="http://www.powermill.com">PowerMILL</a>.
